# Find Office Space Application - Ruby on Rails

2017 CoreNet Global Australia BGIS Hackathon

Problem Statement 2: Workplace Efficiency
â€‹
In the corporate real estate sector at any given time, up to 40% of leased or owned workspace is either empty or unused resulting in costs to the organisation which are considered waste---money which could be invested in profitable business areas instead.

Is there a better way to balance supply and demand between occupiers and users of CRE portfolios?

As a solution to this problem, this application creates a two-sided marketplace between existing tenants with spare office space and potential subtenants looking for spare office space.

## Functionality
- Tenants can create listings for any spare office space they have.
- Potential subtenants can search and browse listings
- Both parties can conveniently negotiate terms of a contract using real-time chat.
- Users must create an account and be authenticated to create a listing or communicate with existing tenants.

## Technologies Used
- Rails 5
